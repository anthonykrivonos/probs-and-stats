Taught by Tat Sang Fung, Columbia University

## Contents

This repository contains lecture notes from the following chapters as Jupyter Notebook files.

All chapters follow the Sheldon M. Ross book,
[*Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers*](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Probability-Statistics-Engineers-Scientists/dp/0123704839).

- [Chapter 2: Descriptive Statistics](chapter-2.ipynb)
- [Chapter 3: Elements of Probability](chapter-3.ipynb)
- [Chapter 4: Random Variables and Expectation](chapter-4.ipynb)
- [Chapter 5: Special Random Variables](chapter-5.ipynb)
- [Chapter 6: Distributions of Sampling Statistics](chapter-6.ipynb)
- [Chapter 7: Parameter Estimation](chapter-7.ipynb)
- [Chapter 8: Hypothesis Testing](chapter-8.ipynb)

Although it is used for this course, it is **highly recommended** to use
a different book, as this one assumes the reader has absurdly more
knowledge on probability and statistics than an actual student
taking such a course for the first time.
