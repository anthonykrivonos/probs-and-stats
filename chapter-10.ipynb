    "Consider $m$ independent samples, each of size $n$, where the members\n",
    "of the $i$th sample ––$X_{i1}, X_{i2}, ..., X_{in}$ –– are *normal* random\n",
    "variables each with unknown mean $\\mu_i$ and unknown variance $\\sigma^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ X_{ij} \\sim N(\\mu_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "$ i = 1, ..., m $\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We want to set up the following hypothesis:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note, since there are a total of $n \\times m$ independent r.v.s for\n",
    "$X_{ij}$, then the sum of the squares of their standard versions will\n",
    "be a *chi-square* distribution!\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\sum^m_{i = 1}\\sum^n_{j = 1}(X_{ij}-\\mu_i)^2/\\sigma^2 \\sim \\chi_{mn}^2$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Doesn't make sense? Just think about the fact that each individual r.v. $Xi$ is\n",

    "### Average of all Elements in One R.V.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Test Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "We can formulate the test statistic $TS$ by comparing the values of $SS_b/(m-1)$ and $SS_W/(nm - m)$,\n",
    "which would obviously be $1$ when $H_0$ is true (remember, this is when all means are equal).\n",
    "\n",
    "$ TS = \\frac{SS_b/(m-1)}{SS_W/(nm - m)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "When this value is substantially greater than 1, it gives us sufficient reason to reject $H_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Significance Level Test of $H_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine how large $TS$ has to be to reject our null hypothesis $H_0$, we use the fact that when\n",
    "$H_0$ is true, $SS_W$ and $SS_b$ are independent of one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, when $H_0$ is true, we can put the relationship between $SS_W$ and $SS_b$ into an F-distribution!\n",
    "\n",
    "We thus skip the statistical B.S. and construct a test for significance level $\\alpha$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reject $H_0$ if $\\frac{SS_b/(m-1)}{SS_W/(nm-m)} \\sim F_{m-1, nm-m, \\alpha}$\n",
    "- **Do not reject** $H_0$ otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "*An auto rental firm is using 15 identical motors that are adjusted to run at a fixed speed to test 3 different brands of gasoline.\n",
    "Each brand of gasoline is assigned to exactly 5 of the motors. Each motor runs on 10 gallons of gasoline until it is out of fuel.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The following total mileages were obtained by the different motors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gas 1: 220 251 226 246 260\n",
    "\n",
    "Gas 2: 244 235 232 242 225\n",
    "\n",
    "Gas 3: 252 272 250 238 256\n",
    "\n",
    "Test the hypothesis that the average mileage obtained is not affected by the type of gas used. Use the 5 percent level of significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, note $X_{ij}$ denotes a certain \"identical motor\" testing a brand of gasoline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, our $H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = ... = \\mu_m$, where $\\mu$ denotes the average mileage of the motor."
